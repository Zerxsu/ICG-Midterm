# ICG Midterm
 Part1: My game ended up being Ice climbers and I spent a little too long on designing the level to make it as similar to the image as possible. I then opened blender and quickly created 2 characters who would be Nana and Popo. I created blocks and scaled them to 1:1 for each piece. The environment is very accurate to the actual game. If I had textures I would have applied them to the blocks to make it more similar to the original game.

 Part2: I created a Toon shader and implemented it onto both characters and adjusted the colors to match each character. I did this by assigning to variables the color and texture in the code and adjusting them accordingly. I went into photoshop and created a simple texture map in which I could use that can be found in the shaders folder of the assets.

 Part3: I ran out of time and couldnt implement the color grading even tho I know how to do it which is frusterating. I would of added a subtle blue tint and make the adjust the highlights by increasing contrast.

 Part4: I decided to use a specular shading on the map as I didnt have any textures but didnt like the flat look of the colors. Now they have a slight shine to it which can indicate a slippery vibe which is what I was going for. 

 Part5: Again I ran out of time but I would of added a simple player movement script to move left and right and a jump to be able to scale the map I created.
